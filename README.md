# Hexa.NET.Shaderc

Hexa.NET.Shaderc is a minimal C# wrapper for the Shaderc library, providing a thin, 1:1 binding to Shaderc's C functions. This wrapper is designed for developers who need direct access to the Shaderc library's functionality from C#, without added complexity or overhead.

## Features

- **Minimal Wrapper**: Provides a direct, 1:1 mapping to the Shaderc C functions, staying true to the original API.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all platforms supported by Shaderc, including Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS.
- **Pre-Built Native Libraries**: The package includes pre-built native libraries, so you don't need to worry about installing Shaderc separately.
